			<h1>TEACHING</h1>
		</section>

		<section class="allIntroText">
			<p> I am an ardent believer in the power of (higher) education, and has been teaching since 2010 and in a professional capacity at various universities since 2014. I believe that we are living in historical times when the forces of technology, industry needs, and society are about to dramatically change education. I see great potential in the future of higher education and my goal as an educator is to try to play my part in pulling that future forward. My teaching approach can be described with the following keywords: research-based, industry-informed, positive learning environment, technology-enhanced, blockchain-inspired, personalized.</p>

				</h3>

			<div class="teachingApproachesDes">
				
					<p class="tabContent" id="practiceOriented"> My teaching is research-based from two distinct standpoints. First, my view is that teaching, indusrty (practice), and research should be in a triadic relationship with each other, each informing the other one. So, while I try to keep my research industry-informed my goal is to bring the findings of my research to the class environment. Second, I design sylabi and prepare the course content based on the most-recent research in educational sciences.</p>

					<p class="tabContent" id="interDisciplinary"> One of my main goals in teaching is to keep education relevant to the realities of the industry, for example through problem-based/project-based learning. Therefore, I promote cooperation and collaboration with industry and try to bring real projects to the classroom or help students define projects that are industry-informed and could be taken to market. I believe that not only this approach motivates students but also helps them to acquire up-to-date knowledge and skills.</p>

			<h3>Personalized Learning and Positive Learning Environment</h3>
			<p> Learning sciences research suggests that more effective learning will occur if each learner receives a customized learning experience. Different learners enter the classroom with different cognitive structures and as we know from neuroscience, individual characteristics are far from fixed. Therefore, students learn best when they are placed in a learning environment that is sensitive to their pre-existing structures and that is flexible enough to adapt teaching strategies to individual needs. I conisder personalized teaching approaches when preparing course contents and assignmnets, continually identifying and responding to students' needs. I achieve this by designing modules flexible and open-ended where students can tailor educational directions and select the assignments that fit their interests, cognitive strucutre, and career plans. Moreover, my emphasis is on creating an active, dynamic, and collaborative class environment (both on campus and online) where students interact with and learn from each other.

			<h3>Blended and Technology-enhanced Learning</h3>
			<p>Unlike the previous generation who grew up in the analog era and gradually adapted to the realities of the digital age, this (and future generations) of students are digital natives and fluently speak the language of technology. Technology is an essential part of my pedagogic approach. I encourage students to use their smartphones, tablets, and laptops in my classes by designing activities and assignments that require the use of different devices and online platforms. I use online platforms for gamification to increase students' interest and to extend their attention spans. Blended learning is at the heart of my pedagogic approach. It allows students to benefit from the advantages of class environment while having control over the pace of learning. </p>

			<h3>Flipped and Blockchain-inspired Learning</h3>
			<p> While, Researchers and developers have envisioned various roles for blockchains in education, including their use for storing standards and issuing credentials, I use the term blockchain-inspired learning to explain one of my approaches in sylabi design and teaching. I borrow the two elements of distribution and decentralization from blockchain technology and apply them to my pedagogic approach. In a blockchain-inspired class the distribution of knowldege is decentralized and therefore the lecturer and the students all participate in the process of knowledge distribution. In other words, I Look at the class space as a network of learning opportunities to invent, innovate, and inspire. </p>

			<h3>Self learning and lifelong learning</h3>
			<p>The inevitability of lifelong learning in knowledge-oriented societies implies that universities should have different objectives and characteristics than if education were considered to have been completed when a student leaves college. Yet in practice, there remains a tendency for the higher education system to be assessed in terms of the achievements and targets that systems have set themselves, rather than their broader success in laying the foundation for lifelong learning. In the knowledge economy, educated workers need a conceptual understanding of complex concepts, and the ability to work with them creatively to generate new ideas, new theories, new products, and new knowledge. They need to be able to take responsibility for their own continuing, life-long learning. So, what students need to learn more than acquiring a set of skills is to learn how to learn. One of my main goals in my classes is to foster self-learning and lifelong learning skills and knowledge.

		<h3>Student Evaluation</h3>
		<p>Student evaluations are central in my approach to module design and development. I believe that evaluations are best when done throughout the semester. Thus, I conduct “check-points” evaluations mid-semester and at the end of each semester, so that I can improve the quality of the module not only for the future classes but also for current students. I collect both quantitave and qualitative data through these evaluations. Further, I depend upon and trust in the relationship and energy I share with my students to communicate on a different level about how things are going. To me, that connection is vital and tells me much more than any quantitative data could.</p>
